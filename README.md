# data-sci-logistic-regression

Hello, 

The purpose of this repos is for resume purposes. This project was created in my data science course for practicing logistic regression. If you'd like to play around with this you must have a virtual environment installed in your computer that runs python notebook files-- jupyter notebook or google colab will do just fine. Please make sure you also download the data.csv file, which is where I'm pulling data from in this exercise, and save it in the same working folder as the .ipynb file. 4

Thanks, Eugenia.
